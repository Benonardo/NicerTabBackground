# NicerTabBackground

Minecraft mod that replaces the black bar in the create world screen with a dark version of the background image

## What this mod does

It replaces the entirely black tab background with a semi-transparent black color that allows the background image to still be visible.  
It will also work with other mods utilising the tab navigation widget.

## Dependencies

None! Like most of my mods, it works out of the box.
